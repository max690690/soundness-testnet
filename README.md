## Testnet Registration
First of all, please follow us on [X](https://x.com/SoundnessLabs).
To join the testnet, generate your keys and head to our `testnet-access` channel in [Discord](https://discord.gg/F4cGbdqgw8) and request access using:

```bash
!access <base64-encoded-public-key>
```

## Usage

### Generating a Key Pair

To generate a new key pair for signing requests:

```bash
soundness-cli generate-key --name my-key
```

### Importing a Key Pair

To import an existing key pair from a mnemonic phrase:

```bash
soundness-cli import-key --name my-key
```

### Listing Key Pairs

To view all stored key pairs and their associated public keys:

```bash
soundness-cli list-keys
```

### Exporting Key Mnemonic

To export the mnemonic phrase for a stored key pair:

```bash
soundness-cli export-key --name my-key
```

> ⚠️ **Warning**: Keep your mnemonic phrase secure and never share it with anyone. Anyone with your mnemonic can access your key pair.

<!-- ### Sending Proofs

To send a proof and ELF file to the testnet server:

```bash
soundness-cli send --proof-file path/to/proof.proof --elf-file path/to/program.elf --key-name my-key
```

The request will be automatically signed using the specified key pair. -->
